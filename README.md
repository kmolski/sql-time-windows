# sql-time-windows
SQL extension for time-based window aggregation

# How to run
Requirements:
- Python 3 (preferably 3.9, might work with other versions)
- Poetry tool for Python (```pip install poetry```)

Running:
1. Run ```poetry install``` in the root directory.
2. Open poetry shell with ```poetry shell``` and run the sql_translator.py script OR use ```poetry run python sql_translator.py```.

The time_window.py script does not require poetry and only depends on sql_generator.py.
